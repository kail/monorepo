# "Hello, world" is overrated
As such, I chose an alternative phrase -- one that I have been stuck with since childhood.
I believe it translates to "Hello/Goodbye child" and is a phrase which my Russian father used while we were
growing up. However after some non-exhaustive Google-ing, it turns out that the phrase may be more commonly
used with the "Hello, baby" connotation. It's funny how things don't translate; but I digress.

While this public-facing portal of opinions holds far less value than I anticipate
my "baby" would, I do hope to to treat it in a somewhat professional manner, and one which I can
use to improve my writing and delivery of ideas. I guess time will tell. Perge!
