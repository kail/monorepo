# about me
Hey, I'm Mikhail! I'm currently working at [Lyft](https://lyft.com) as a Firmware Engineer on the [Bikes and Scooters](https://www.lyft.com/bikes) team, however I spent my first two years building a [multimodal routing engine](https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-multimodal-app). Previously I worked on malicious ad-blocking solutions at [AdLightning](https://www.adlightning.com/) -- now [Boltive](https://www.boltive.com/) -- and had a 3-year stint at Microsoft.

My undergraduate alma mater is [the real UW](https://www.wisc.edu/) (even though they don't have the domain), however I also have a M.S. in Computer Science from [the other UW](http://www.uw.edu/)
as I have been living in Seattle, WA for the past 7 years.

Aside from mashing buttons on my computer, I enjoy tinkering with engines, flying planes, DIY projects, and cooking.

My Github alias is [kail](https://github.com/kail) which is what my friends call me, but everywhere
else you can probably find me via the `skobovm` alias (e.g. [email](mailto:skobovm@gmail.com)).
